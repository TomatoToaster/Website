        <p>This a personal website I made to review some of the concepts I've learned making websites.
          It sometimes acts as a playground but mostly I use it to be a sort of portfolio.</p>
        <p>Hope you're enjoying this website so far! 
          Right now there's not much but some template pages but it'll be good soon I swear!</p>

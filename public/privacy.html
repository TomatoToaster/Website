  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 24, 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy applies to all games and apps published under the name
    <strong>TomatoToaster</strong> ("we," "our," or "us").
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    We do not collect personal information directly from users such as names,
    email addresses, or account details. Our games do not require accounts or
    sign-ins.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, some of our games use third-party services that may collect limited
    data automatically in order to function properly.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    Our games may display advertisements provided by Google AdMob. AdMob may
    collect certain information automatically, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device identifiers (such as advertising identifiers)</li>
    <li>Approximate (coarse) location derived from IP address</li>
    <li>Ad interaction data (such as impressions and clicks)</li>
    <li>Diagnostic information (such as crash or performance data)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This information is used to provide, improve, and measure advertising.
    Data collection and use are governed by Google’s Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Tracking and Personalized Ads</h2>
  <p>
    We do not knowingly track users across apps or websites owned by other
    companies. Where required by law, users may be asked for consent before
    personalized advertising is shown.
  </p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Our games are intended for a general audience and do not knowingly collect
    personal information from children. Advertising services used in our games
    are configured to comply with applicable child privacy laws, including the
    Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), where required.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will
    always be available on this page with a revised effective date.
